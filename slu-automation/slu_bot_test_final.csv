Who should file the FAFSA,"FAFSA guidelines say you should answer the parent section using information about the household in which have lived most for the 12 months before filing.

The parent with whom you lived or provided more financial support during the last 12 months is identified as the custodial parent, and you will use that parent's information on the FAFSA. If the custodial parent is remarried as of the date you are filing your FAFSA, answer the questions using information about your parent and your step parent.

What is SLU's conduct process?,"If a student is documented for being involved in a potential policy violation, he or she will receive an “individual hearing.” At that time, your student will have the opportunity to discuss the incident with the University hearing officer.

This hearing is set apart from any civil or criminal legal process.

Students must represent themselves. Attorneys are not permitted. Failure to attend will result in the case being decided in the student’s absence, as well as a failure to comply violation.

Should the student accept responsibility for the charges, he or she will receive sanctions designed to educate them about how their actions impact themselves and others. If a student does not agree with the violation(s) or sanctions, they have three days to appeal. The appeal will be sent to the Student Appeal Board, which is made up of undergraduate students. Its determination is final.","If a student is documented for being involved in a potential policy violation, he or she will receive an “individual hearing.” At that time, your student will have the opportunity to discuss the incident with the University hearing officer.
